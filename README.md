# BlockFi Case Study
BlockFi was founded in 2017 by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez.


Representing the Alternative Finance domain. BlockFi is a centralized crypto lender, where assets are held with a custodian on the BlockFi platformâ€”bridging traditional finance and crypto-asset markets by providing savings, credit, and trading products to crypto holders. BlockFi was created to provide credit services to markets with limited access to simple financial products. BlockFi is currently being valued at $3 billion. They raised a total of $508.7M in funding over 16 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Jan 3, 2022, from a Secondary Market round. [Cited: CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockfi-inc).  BlockFi is growing extremely fast too. It was on track to make $475 million in gross revenue in 2021. They make their money through interest fees, withdrawal fees, spreads, sponsorship fees, crypto mining, as well as premiums collected from investments into other trusts.

 
Thousands of people have made millions of dollars by buying and holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But to spend the currency they need to sell their coins. That's a problem, because selling triggers capital gains taxes in the US, and because most crypto-wealthy people believe bitcoin will only keep going up in value over time, holding onto the coin is the best option. BlockFi solves this problem by offering USD loans backed by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as collateral. BlockFi also provides interest accounts, cryptocurrency trading, and crypto rewards.


BlockFi's target customer is underserved crypto investors. As of 2021, it's estimated that there are over 300 million crypto users worldwide. [Cited: TripleA](https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/)

Cryptocurrency-backed loans are becoming a competitive space. Companies like Nexo, Celsius, and Salt offer rates on their loans as low as 1%.
As an example of the size of this market, Genesis, one of the largest Over-the-Counter (OTC) players, claims $150B in cumulative originations and a current loan book of $12.5B.

Major trends in crypto lending are regulation, developing DeFi protocols for undercollateralized loans, and more involvement from traditional financial institutions and businesses. Several companies have been in discussion with regulators from the U.S. Security and Exchange (SEC). Most recently, the SEC is taking a closer look at Celsius, Gemini, and Voyager Digital. The SEC is deciding whether the lending companies need to register their assets as securities with the SEC.
BlockFi is a major player in the crypto-loan space. They recently had to pay a penalty of $100 Million to the SEC and file registration of its crypto lending products. They "also agree to attempt to bring its business into compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940 within 60 days." [Cited: SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-26)


Another trend in crypto lending is making crypto-backed loans more accessible to people who don't have a large amount of capital available as collateral. Recently, several protocols aimed at bringing under collateralized and uncollateralized loans to DeFi in a safe way have been gaining traction.


The last major trend is that traditional institutions and institutional investors are more interested in crypto lending. There was an introduction to credit scores on crypto lending platform, at the beginning of 2022, when the TransUnion credit firm announced a partnership with data exchange security firm Spring Lab. To obtain a lower interest rate borrowers would be able to share their credit information with lenders.


As the crypto lending industry keeps growing, government regulations and traditional finance will become more interesting. It will gain a wider appeal with crypto skeptics and older investors. By watching the trends in the crypto lending space, the younger and older investors can get a better picture of the market and its future and learn from it.

BlockFi has seen incredible growth over the past four years as crypto investing and financial services have moved to the mainstream. They recently launched a new credit card that allows clients to accumulate rewards in cryptocurrency. Improving the loan experience is their priority by making it easier to pay down loans and get up-to-date loan and payment status information. They also want to prioritize expanding internationally.

If I were to advise BlockFi to add new products I would ask that they offer reward debit cards.  This would be similar to their credit cards rewards without having to apply for credit. This would allow more users to gain crypto rewards. I would also recommend that they offer more loan options to people that don't have large amounts of capital available. This would make lending more inclusive and bring more capital for investors.
